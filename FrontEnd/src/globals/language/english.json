  "about_description_exam": "As an exam project, we had to create a project of our choice that reflects our knowledge from the education. I have chosen to create an application where you can search for pokemon cards from the TCG series. Search for the sets, cards, artists and more. Create collections to see which ones you own and have left in sets or even create a collection with your favorite pokemon.",
  "about_description_goal": "After these 6 weeks I want to have developed something that is usable both for searching and as an overview tool to make the collecting easier and more manageable.",
  "about_description_purpose": "As a collector of Pok√©mon cards it is hard to keep up with all the cards that are in the collection. If you buy an ETB(Elite Trainer Box) you get a folder that contains all the cards in that set, but it still doesn't really give you a good overview on the collection as a whole. And if you want to collect the full set it makes it harder when you can't be sure of which cards you have or not. This app would make the collecting easier and more time effective.",
