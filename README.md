## EXAM Assignment

My idea for this assignment:
Create an application where you can search for pokemon cards from the TCG series. Search for the sets, cards, artists and more. Create collections to see which ones you own and have left in sets or even create a collection with your favorite pokemon.

### Purpose

As a collector of Pok√©mon cards it is hard to keep up with all the cards that are in the collection. If you buy an ETB(Elite Trainer Box) you get a folder that contains all the cards in that set, but it still doesn't really give you a good overview on the collection as a whole. And if you want to collect the full set it makes it harder when you can't be sure of which cards you have or not. This app would make the collecting easier and more time effective.

### Technical breakdown

The app will have functionality to search for cards but also to save the cards to a user account. As a logged in user you will be able to create collections and save cards to your collections.
On the site you will also be able to search for artists, ex search on sowsow and get all the cards where they are the artist. This will make it easier to check if an artist you like has designed more cards or even to start a collection with all the cards that this artist has designed.

### Demo

To get it up and running follow these steps:

#### Frontend

1. install all dependencies by writing "npm i" in the terminal (don't forget to be in the Frontend folder)
2. to compile ts to js write "npm run build" and get a dist file
3. to get the site up at localhost to see it write "npm run dev".

#### Backend

1. install all dependencies by writing "npm i" in the terminal (don't forget to be in the Backend folder)
2. to seed the database with mockdata write "npm run seedDb"
3. to get the server up at localhost "npm run start".
